# Contribution Guide for Hacktoberfest

We will be starting off with frontend of our app.

## Choose one
- I want to work on a component (ex... button, input, etc)
- I want to work on a page
- I want to add animation for better UX
- I want to make improvements (ps. Describe what you will be improving and how will it be different from the existing code)

## STEPS

- Create an issue
- Describe what you want to work on.
- Describe how will you be solving a problem.
- Wait for confirmation
- after confirming, we will create a branch for you

That's it ! Now you can simply checkout to that branch, and push your code in that branch and raise a pull request.
